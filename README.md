# js-toys

Some small (old-shool) amusements I like to code from time to time.

No planning. No quality. Only raw coding and fun.

## Running the demos

Open the included html files in order to view run the toy. But browser security is a shitshow, so some of themÂ will require to use a web server (I don't remember which).

I included a `make` target to start a Python web server.

```sh
$ make serve
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser and navigate the repo tree up to the html you want to open.

## clock

Clock and calendar widgets. I use it on an old phone in kiosk mode.

## peg-solitaire

A peg solitaire game.

One afternoon, my daughter told me she wanted to play peg solitaire on her iPad. After searching for a very simple game on the App Store (no internet, not ads, no logins...) without luck, I ended writing her the game that same afternoon.
